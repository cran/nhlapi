## Installation

You can install nhlapi from CRAN. 

```r
install.packages("nhlapi")
```

You can also install the latest development version from the master branch on GitHub using the remotes package:

```r
remotes::install_github("jozefhajnala/nhlapi")
```

## Usage

You retrieve the data from the NHL API by calling the functions exported by the nhlapi package. They start with `nhl_` so you can easily find them with autocomplete in your favourite editor:
